/*

To continuously monitor the impermanent loss incurred for a position in Uniswap V3 and automatically exit the position if the loss exceeds a certain threshold, you can use a smart contract that periodically checks the impermanent loss of the position and calls the LP exiting function if the loss exceeds the threshold.

Here is a high-level overview of the process:

1. Set up a smart contract that is connected to the Uniswap V3 subgraph and has access to the necessary information about the position, such as the tokens, the price at the time of providing liquidity, and the current tick in the pool.

2. In the smart contract, implement a function that calculates the impermanent loss of the position based on the above information.

3. Set up a timer or an event that will trigger the smart contract to periodically check the impermanent loss of the position.

4. When the impermanent loss exceeds the threshold, have the smart contract call the LP exiting function to exit the position.

5. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain and interact with it to start monitoring and exiting the position as needed.

/*
The startMonitoring function can be called to start the monitoring process. This function schedules the checkAndExit function to be called every CHECK_INTERVAL seconds.
The repeatCheck function is an internal function that is used to schedule the checkAndExit function to be called again after a certain interval. This function is also called when the contract receives Ether, which allows the contract to continue monitoring even if it runs out of gas.
